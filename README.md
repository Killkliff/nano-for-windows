# NANO FOR WINDOWS

This is the Windows version of the legendary **[GNU nano text editor](https://www.nano-editor.org/)**, a small and compact CLI editor that packs a world of functionality in a small footprint (less than 300KB) based on the pico editor.

GNU nano is constantly being upgraded, but the original project is limited to providing support and functionality only for Linux. This project is meant to bring the latest updates to Windows 64/32.
